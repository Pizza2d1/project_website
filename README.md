# Project Website
Right now I am working on trying to make a portfolio website while learning php in college so that I can have a cool custom webpage. So far it's not very interesting but soon it will have as much character as some of the [neocities](https://neocities.org/browse) pages that I've been exploring online recently, because they just have so much life to them

### Includes RSS
I also use this as a way to post my blog, creating it in markdown and using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to convert it to xml format for rss feeds. But if you don't have an rss viewer, I use php [Parsedown](https://parsedown.org) to format my markdown motes into hmtl using [simple css](https://simplecss.org) to make it look nice.

### W.I.P.
This page is still in progress as I continue to work on the pages that I put in the navbar

#### Currently working on:
- Image/Video converter to most common formats -> To learn about ffmpeg.
- Certifications page -> To show off the certs I got in school.
- CSS customization -> To make my page look unique and not blocky like most boring pages.
- Learning javascript -> I really hate having to learn javascript, so learning it to customize my website could be a fun way of doing it.
