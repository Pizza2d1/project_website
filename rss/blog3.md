## Theory of guilt

### __Preface__:

First off, I want to let you understand what I mean by my meaning of guilt. Guilt can be in the things you do, the things you are, and the things you wish. Strongly emphasizing that the difference between you as a person and what is "normal" can drive your guilt just as much as what you do. Things such as your ugly body, your messed up brain, your unusual ideas, they all belong in the category of being atypical, where you feel bad just for not being "normal", that feeling of guilt. Jealousy can just as well fit into this, but in the case where you know that it's abnormal and feel bad about it is when it turns into the case of being guilty.

## __What we do__:

In the cases where I've noticed this, where people feel guilt, a small amount seem to wallow in self-pain and self-doubt and feel like they can't improve and that they deserve to suffer. The other side of this, is a strong desire to become better BECAUSE of the guilt that they feel, acting as their drive to become much better than others in order to make-up for their guilt. You see this in cases such as:

- Furries: Taking up a large portion of the tech industry and making tons of money
- Minorities (such as trans people and immigrants): Working harder and being some of the nicest people you'll ever meet
- Recovered Addicts: Having better willpower than most, along with being really chill to hang out with
- This [plane fetishist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldvtvBSbeQU): Being really good at aircraft maintenance
